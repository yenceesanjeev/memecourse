# Best practices

## Pay attention to quality
I take memes seriously. Therefore, I don't want any sub par memes going out in my name just like I wouldn't want a sub par blog post going out in my name. I watch out for things like formating, typos, quality of the screenshot etc and try to do the best that I can.

## Time it, but not always
I've experimented by posting memes at different times to see what really worked. While it's not always applicable, try to aim for sweet spots like early afternoons or evenings.

However, memes are also best served hot. If you notice a hot topic trending on the internet then now is always better than later (even if it's not the optimal time)

## Never ask people to like or share your memes
I'm very particular about forcing my creative work on people. I will share them on my profile where people can see it. If they like it, they like it. If they don't, they don't. If any of your friends don't like what you create, let them be. This is generallly applicable to any creative content.

## Don't optimise for likes & shares
Social media has quantified everything. Therefore, we associate the success or failure of something with likes and shares. If you start playing that game, you'll never be happy as there's always a higher number to aim for.

I usually try not to worry too much about likes and shares but they do get to me at times. I've also painfully taken down memes that don't receive engagement. This is a hard pill to swallow.

## Create for yourself
Just like any other art, meme creation is about enjoying the process. If you look at your own meme and laugh, that's victory right there. Anything else that follows is a bonus

## Watermarks
I've always been conflicted by adding watermarks. I personally choose to not add watermarks because it's one thing lesst to do. I also believe that watermarks don't add value to the meme and hence they shouldn't be there. But ask anyone whose memes have been stolen, they instantly regret not adding watermarks

Oh, even if you add watermarks there are harmful internet people who will recreate your memes, add their own watermarks and flaunt it on their profile as their own. There's nothing you can do about it.

## Don't preach or educate
Memes are supposed to be funny. If I want to preach or educate, I will write a blog post instead. It's not to say that you can't learn a thing or two from memes, you can but that's not its primary purpose.
