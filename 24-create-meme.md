### Template
Placing the template here, you'll have to decide how you want to call out certain elements through microcopies. for example, if there are people in the image â€” you might want to use subtle cues to call out different people for extra effect
In this case, explicitly calling out captain as Jupiter and using the names of the other planets, this adds to the effect.

Be careful to not crowd the template. The words on the template is simply an aid, the focus should be on the main copy.

### Copy
While writing the copy, keep these general best practices in mind
Less is more
You don't want to confuse the audience. Make them work for your joke but not too much. The copy is not the place to showcase your English skills. Make it relatable but not hard to read
Use reltabale worlds
Don't go off a tangent and use words that people will never get
There are only two popular meme templates
