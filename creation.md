Let's talk about meme creation in a 7 step process

## 1 Find the concept
This is the beginning, the source, the root of everything.
You find the idea or the idea can find you. There are many ways in which you can find the idea. Here are some possible scenarios
The only rule while thinking about ideas is this — your idea should be known and relatable enough.

### Everyday situations
Much like stand up comedians, you could make a meme out of situations in your own life. Find something annoying at work? That could be a meme. Soemthing annoys you at home? That could be a meme.

### Pubic situations
You could also use memes as a way to comment on any public situations that are happening. IPL matches, Big Boss, News, Politics. All of these are candidates for memes
Example

### Closed door memes
These are memes that only a certain group of people will understand, that's okay. As long as your audience get it, you could be making an impact through that meme.

### Conversational memes
Memes can also be used in everyday conersations or conversations with friends. Responding to a normal coversation through a meme is a great way to attract clout. It's the real world equivalent of cracking jokes as part of a regular conversation.

### Sourcing inspiration by consuming content
Sometimes, you'll not be able to locate the essence of the meme until you watch the template. Make it a habit to watch Adithya TV or Sirippoli channel everyday for at least 2 hours to train your brain into looking for cues. It can be trained to understand and look for memes.

Once your brain is trained, there's no going back.

## 2 Decide the format
Once you've decided the concept, it's time to decide the format of your meme. Here are the 3 major formats

### Image Memes
The classic format. Just the template and the copy.
This works beautifully in most scenarios and also the easiest to consume. However, this is slightly tricky to create because you need to identify the right screenshot for maximum impact.
Also, you're writing the copy so everything depends on the way you write it
When to use it?
  When you have the modify the original dialoge
  When the template is famous enough that people can play the dialogue back in their head
  When the frame conveys exactly the emotion that you want to convey

Pros
- Easy on the eyes for the audience
- Easy to share with their friends
- Can be consumed in a quick succession

Cons
- Tricky to take screenshots at the right time
- The accompanying copy should be strong or the meme falls flat

Example
This image meme would work well because this dialogue of "Unna evan jaangari kuduka sonnathu" is famous enough for audience to make a connection with your copy immediately. They would read it in that tone and it would immediately make sense.

### GIF memes
This has grown in popularity over the recent times thanks to social media platforms supporting GIFs. GIFs are harder to create but they provide a perfect balance between video memes and image memes

The reactions and expressions and the action itself can be easily conveyed through a GIF without the hassle of turning on the audio for the audience. GIFs are also far more accurate in conveying the reaction than an image

When to use it
When you think the reaction cannot be conveyed in a single frame
When the dialogue of the scene is inconsequential
When you need the reaction but not the dialogue

Pros
- Easier to consume than video memes
- The reaction is accurately captured so your copy can be light

Cons
- Hardest to create
- Sharing formats can be tricky
- A simple copy paste won't work

Example
In this situation, an image would've been hard to convey the message of emptying the pocket. At the same time, a video meme would've been an overkill because the audio doesn't add value at all

In the below example, the dialogue in the audio doesn't fit our concept and hence would've been a distraction.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When someone opens their mask to talk to me <a href="https://t.co/phtWvnh1LB">pic.twitter.com/phtWvnh1LB</a></p>&mdash; Sanjeev NC (@yenceesanjeev) <a href="https://twitter.com/yenceesanjeev/status/1299997595373383680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 30, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


### Video memes
Something that's growing in popularity over the last few years thanks to better internet, powerful smartphones and fully capable mobile video editors

When to use
When the dialogue fits **perfectly** in your essence. The essence of the meme is fully comparabale with the template
When the template is not so popular so you have to rekindle the memory with the scene

Pros
- Lowest work for the copy as the template would do the trick itself
- Provides the maximum impact as the accompanying video will provide them with the laughter essence

Cons
- Good quality videos can be hard to source
- You'll have to trim for precision
- Even one unnecessary word in the video could disturb the essence

Example
Here the dialogue fits perfectly in the situation, hence a good candidate for video memes
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When people mark you as optional in meeting invites <a href="https://t.co/58xku7xpM5">pic.twitter.com/58xku7xpM5</a></p>&mdash; Sanjeev NC (@yenceesanjeev) <a href="https://twitter.com/yenceesanjeev/status/1297778619511713798?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 24, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Pro tip
- You could try your hand at advanced skills like
- Meme Dub Videos
- Editing out the unncessary words
- Mixing two different scenes

## 3 Source the template
Once you have the format decided, the next step is to source the templates. Let's look at possible sources for these templates

### Image memes
It's the easiest to get but tricky to choose. Most of the templates are easily available on the internet.
Before sourcing it yourself, try searching for the right keyword on Google under the image search section. If that doesn't get you what you want, then you can go on YouTube to get the right template

Watch out for
- The right framed screenshot
- Quality of the image
- Bad hand movements

Example
While both the screenshots are only few seconds apart, you can clearly see that the second one conveys the dialogue better. Spend some time moving the image around to find the right one that fits.

### GIF memes
This one is slightly harder. The chances of the GIF already being avaiable is pretty slim. Even if it is, it may not be cut to its precision.

In this case, your best bet is to use a third party website like [gifs.com](http://gifs.com) to create it yourself

### Video memes
Even though it looks complex, video memes are the easiest source. On most smartphones, the screenrecord option is good enough. You should be able to record over YouTube videos to get the template.
However, it's becoming increasingly difficult to source HD templates on YouTube and that is a worriable cause. Hence, you'll spend a lot of time finding the right video. Even if you own a subscription to SunNxt or Amazon Prime - they won't let you tape over them.

Pro Tip: If you're really serious about meme creation, I would recommend investing in a VPN software. It lets you access pirtated websits time einthusan and tamilyogi. That makes the entire process of sourcing templates very smooth because you always have access to HD templates and you don't have to waste time in searching

## 4 Create the actual meme
Once you've done all the above, then this becomes the easiest part. It's just a matter of mixing and matching the right ingrideints

### Place the template
Based on the format and your device, pick a tool of your choice.
Images
memegenerator
Kapow
GIF
[gifs.com](http://gifs.com)
Videos
Inshot

### Template
Placing the template here, you'll have to decide how you want to call out certain elements through microcopies. for example, if there are people in the image — you might want to use subtle cues to call out different people for extra effect
In this case, explicitly calling out captain as Jupiter and using the names of the other planets, this adds to the effect.

Be careful to not crowd the template. The words on the template is simply an aid, the focus should be on the main copy.

### Copy
While writing the copy, keep these general best practices in mind
Less is more
You don't want to confuse the audience. Make them work for your joke but not too much. The copy is not the place to showcase your English skills. Make it relatable but not hard to read
Use reltabale worlds
Don't go off a tangent and use words that people will never get
There are only two popular meme templates

Classic
- White text
- Black background
- Impact Font

Modern
- Black background
- White text
- Helvetica Font

Example

Once you're in the template, the most important step here is to craft the copy

## 5 Review the elements

### Template
- Is my template relatable?
- Is my template famous enough?
- Is my template offensive?

### Copy
- Is my copy understandable?
- Can I remove more words from my copy?
- Can I make my copy scrappier?
- Is my copy readable?
- Are the fonts legible?

### Concept
- Is my concept popular enough for the audience?
- Is my concept reltable enough for the audience?
- Am I offending someone by picking this concept?

### Essence
- Does the essence capture the concept?
- Is the essence of the meme the same as the essence of the situation?

### Connection
- Does the copy connect well with the template?
