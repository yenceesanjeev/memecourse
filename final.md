Thank you for reading this through. I didn't know if there was a need for a guide like this but if you've managed to get to this point, probably there is.

I would love to hear what you thought about this guide. Please feel free to reach out on Twitter -> [@yenceesanjeev](https://twitter.com/yenceesanjeev) and Instagram -> [@yenceesanjeev](https://www.instagram.com/yenceesanjeev/). I also share memes here so if you liked the examples used in this guide, you can find more such content on my profile.

I genuinely belive that meme creation is an art. Someday, I want to create a full fledged online video course (like the ones you see on Udemy). Someday.

I really enjoyed creating this guide. I initially wanted to sell this as paid content but I honestly couldn't figure out how to do that. So, I decided against it. If you learnt something from this, do consider supporting me through the "Buy me a coffee" widget on the bottom right.

Here's your incentive if you support me - I'll give you a 50% off on the video course when I launch it in the future.

So, for my final words...
