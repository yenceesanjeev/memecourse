## Twitter
The best part about twitter is that it's natural Tweet compose platform yields itself to a pretty comfortable meme. You don't need a separate meme generator app to create memes before posting here
If you're using two separate images, make sure the dimensions are 1:1. Otherwise, Twitter algorithm will choose where to focus on and as people are scrolling down, it won't have the same effect

Twitter is also your best bet if you're trying to reach virality. Twitter's algorithm works in such a way that it amplifies good content beyond your second degree connections. If someone likes your tweet, it automatically gets amplified
But Twitter audience are also among the most critical ones. You'll not be able to get away with mediocre content
Watch out for the dimensions when you create content on Twitter. It automatically crops so my best bet would be to just crop the content yourself so that you don't leave anything for the algorithm to figure out
