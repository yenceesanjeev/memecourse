The best part about twitter is that it's natural Tweet compose platform yields itself to a pretty comfortable meme. You don't need a separate meme generator app to create memes before posting here. It's very quick to just get a template and make your meme right on Twitter.

### Example
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When colleagues want to do &#39;a quick meeting&#39; to discuss something <br><br>&quot;Eppoyachu meeting na okay, eppovume meeting na eppadi?&quot; <a href="https://t.co/imdxCVps5r">pic.twitter.com/imdxCVps5r</a></p>&mdash; Sanjeev NC (@yenceesanjeev) <a href="https://twitter.com/yenceesanjeev/status/1321394166081835008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


I also find that Twitter audience have a better meme sense than Instagram. Mediocre memes will not go viral on Twitter but almost anything can trend on Instagram.


Twitter is also your best bet if you're trying to reach virality. Twitter's algorithm works in such a way that it amplifies good content beyond your second degree connections. If someone likes your tweet, it automatically gets amplified.

The different kinds of memes you can do on Twitter

## Uploading a single image meme

 If you upload an image that's not in a 16:9 format, then Twtiter will choose where it wants to focus on

If you're using two separate images, make sure the dimensions are 1:1. Otherwise, Twitter algorithm will choose where to focus on and as people are scrolling down, it won't have the same effect

The easiest way to check this is through the edit button and picking the wide format. That's your preview.
You can play around with it to ensure it fits the right format.

### Uploading a multi image meme
Sometimes, you would need more than one template to convey your message. Like This

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google Chrome giving RAM to other applications<br><br>&quot;100 MB da. Paathu selavu pannu&quot; <a href="https://t.co/7xUVJJb1mA">pic.twitter.com/7xUVJJb1mA</a></p>&mdash; Sanjeev NC (@yenceesanjeev) <a href="https://twitter.com/yenceesanjeev/status/1314770617950855169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

In this case, Twitter crops it to the 1:1 ratio. For mutli image memes, make sure you crop it yourself to fit the 1:1 ratio using the edit section.

### Twitter Threads

You can use Twitter threads if you want to chain similar kinds of memes together. Some examples below

A "Things people say/shit people do" thread

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Things people say on Zoom calls, a thread<br><br>‚ÄúHas everyone joined the call?‚Äù <a href="https://t.co/Zuo112uk7R">pic.twitter.com/Zuo112uk7R</a></p>&mdash; Sanjeev NC (@yenceesanjeev) <a href="https://twitter.com/yenceesanjeev/status/1287762208974204932?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 27, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

A comaprison between two unrelated areas

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">LinkedIn emojis as Vadivelu, a thread<br><br>üî• <a href="https://t.co/Q585PLoCrg">pic.twitter.com/Q585PLoCrg</a></p>&mdash; Sanjeev NC (@yenceesanjeev) <a href="https://twitter.com/yenceesanjeev/status/1315156447844421636?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 11, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

A meme story

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Two weeks back, I signed up with Zerodha and started investing in stock markets. I exited yesterday. <br><br>My two-week experience ft. Vadivelu, a thread<br><br>It started with asking advice about stock markets <a href="https://t.co/5Ealon7h8d">pic.twitter.com/5Ealon7h8d</a></p>&mdash; Sanjeev NC (@yenceesanjeev) <a href="https://twitter.com/yenceesanjeev/status/1242530191714349056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 24, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The formatting options are exactly the same here but some general practices to follow while creating a threads
- Ensure that your first tweet indicates that it's a thread. You can do this by starting the tweet with "1/" or explicitly mentioning "A thread"
- You could do unlimited additions but 7 - 10 works best
