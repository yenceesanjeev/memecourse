---
This is the beginning, the source, the root of everything.

You find the situation or the situation can find you. You could discover situations in many ways, here are some

## Everyday situations
You could make a meme out of situations in your own life.
- Find something annoying at work? That could be a meme.
- Something annoys you at home? That could be a meme.
- Not an Apple fan? There's a meme there somewhere
- Watching IPL? There are memes there too

## Pubic situations
You could also use memes as a way to comment on any public situations that are happening. IPL matches, Big Boss, News, Politics. All of these are candidates for memes

Note: Tread with caution. You'll find that it's very easy to offend people.

## Closed door memes
These are memes that only a certain group of people will understand, that's okay. As long as your audience get it, you could be making an impact through that meme.

A typical example is the office whatsapp group where you could create and share memes very specific to that context.

## Conversational memes
Memes can also be used in everyday conersations or conversations with friends. Responding to a normal conversation through a meme is a great way to attract clout. It's the real world equivalent of cracking jokes as part of a regular conversation.

Of course, it's a lot of effort. So if you're using it in a conversation, it better be worth it.

## Sourcing inspiration by consuming content
Sometimes, you'll not be able to locate the situation of the meme until you watch the template. Make it a habit to watch Adithya TV or Sirippoli channel everyday for at least 2 hours to train your brain into looking for cues. It can be trained to understand and look for memes.

Once your brain is trained, there's no going back.

The only rule while discovering situations is this â€” it should be known and relatable enough. If you're going to create a meme about something that only you have context about, no one's going to find that funny.
