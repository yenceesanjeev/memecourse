## 1 Find the concept
This is the beginning, the source, the root of everything.
You find the idea or the idea can find you. There are many ways in which you can find the idea. Here are some possible scenarios
The only rule while thinking about ideas is this â€” your idea should be known and relatable enough.

### Everyday situations
Much like stand up comedians, you could make a meme out of situations in your own life. Find something annoying at work? That could be a meme. Soemthing annoys you at home? That could be a meme.

### Pubic situations
You could also use memes as a way to comment on any public situations that are happening. IPL matches, Big Boss, News, Politics. All of these are candidates for memes

### Closed door memes
These are memes that only a certain group of people will understand, that's okay. As long as your audience get it, you could be making an impact through that meme.

### Conversational memes
Memes can also be used in everyday conersations or conversations with friends. Responding to a normal coversation through a meme is a great way to attract clout. It's the real world equivalent of cracking jokes as part of a regular conversation.

### Sourcing inspiration by consuming content
Sometimes, you'll not be able to locate the essence of the meme until you watch the template. Make it a habit to watch Adithya TV or Sirippoli channel everyday for at least 2 hours to train your brain into looking for cues. It can be trained to understand and look for memes.

Once your brain is trained, there's no going back.
