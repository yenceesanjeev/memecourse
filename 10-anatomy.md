A meme consists of **five distinct elements** grouped into **two section.**
## The Visible Elements
  The visible elements of the memes are the ones you can directly see an interact. They are your levers to craft the perfect meme.

  They are:
  - Copy
  - Template


## The Invisible Elements
  The invisible elements are the ones that you can not see, interact or impact. But, the absence of these elements will be felt. You control the invisible elements by adjusting the visible ones.

  They are:
  - Situation
  - Story
  - Connection

## Example
![](/images/anatomy/example.png)

#### The Visible elements
**Copy**
"When you can neither be happy bor be rich in life" & micro copies
"My Life", "Happiness" and "Money"

**Template**
"Ohhh jodiya miss aagireengala" from Middle Class Madhavan

#### The Invisible Elements
**Concept**
Your life has no happiness or money

**Essence**
Two things are missing in your life

**Connection**
Both Kozhanthaivelu and my life are asking "Ohh, jodiya miss aagareengala?"

## Why are these elements important?
A meme is funny when it's got the right balance in all these elements. It's like cooking -- you need the right ingredients (elements) in the right ratio and when something is missing, you notice right away. If something is added in excess, you notice that too.

There are always exceptions.
