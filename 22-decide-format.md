title: 2.2 Decide Format
---
---

Once you've decided the concept, it's time to decide the format of your meme. Here are the 3 major formats

### Image Memes
The classic format. Just the template and the copy.
This works beautifully in most scenarios and also the easiest to consume. However, this is slightly tricky to create because you need to identify the right screenshot for maximum impact.
Also, you're writing the copy so everything depends on the way you write it
When to use it?
  When you have the modify the original dialoge
  When the template is famous enough that people can play the dialogue back in their head
  When the frame conveys exactly the emotion that you want to convey

Pros
- Easy on the eyes for the audience
- Easy to share with their friends
- Can be consumed in a quick succession

Cons
- Tricky to take screenshots at the right time
- The accompanying copy should be strong or the meme falls flat

Example
This image meme would work well because this dialogue of "Unna evan jaangari kuduka sonnathu" is famous enough for audience to make a connection with your copy immediately. They would read it in that tone and it would immediately make sense.

### GIF memes
This has grown in popularity over the recent times thanks to social media platforms supporting GIFs. GIFs are harder to create but they provide a perfect balance between video memes and image memes

The reactions and expressions and the action itself can be easily conveyed through a GIF without the hassle of turning on the audio for the audience. GIFs are also far more accurate in conveying the reaction than an image

When to use it
When you think the reaction cannot be conveyed in a single frame
When the dialogue of the scene is inconsequential
When you need the reaction but not the dialogue

Pros
- Easier to consume than video memes
- The reaction is accurately captured so your copy can be light

Cons
- Hardest to create
- Sharing formats can be tricky
- A simple copy paste won't work

Example
In this situation, an image would've been hard to convey the message of emptying the pocket. At the same time, a video meme would've been an overkill because the audio doesn't add value at all

In the below example, the dialogue in the audio doesn't fit our concept and hence would've been a distraction.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When someone opens their mask to talk to me <a href="https://t.co/phtWvnh1LB">pic.twitter.com/phtWvnh1LB</a></p>&mdash; Sanjeev NC (@yenceesanjeev) <a href="https://twitter.com/yenceesanjeev/status/1299997595373383680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 30, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


### Video memes
Something that's growing in popularity over the last few years thanks to better internet, powerful smartphones and fully capable mobile video editors

When to use
When the dialogue fits **perfectly** in your essence. The essence of the meme is fully comparabale with the template
When the template is not so popular so you have to rekindle the memory with the scene

Pros
- Lowest work for the copy as the template would do the trick itself
- Provides the maximum impact as the accompanying video will provide them with the laughter essence

Cons
- Good quality videos can be hard to source
- You'll have to trim for precision
- Even one unnecessary word in the video could disturb the essence

Example
Here the dialogue fits perfectly in the situation, hence a good candidate for video memes
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When people mark you as optional in meeting invites <a href="https://t.co/58xku7xpM5">pic.twitter.com/58xku7xpM5</a></p>&mdash; Sanjeev NC (@yenceesanjeev) <a href="https://twitter.com/yenceesanjeev/status/1297778619511713798?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 24, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
