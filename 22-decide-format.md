title: 2.2 Decide Format
---
---

Once you've found the situation, it's time to decide the format of your meme.

Here are the 3 major formats

## Image Memes
The classic format. Just the template and the copy.

Image memes were the first type of memes to emerge as it was the easiest to create. You can simply use any kind of image editing tool to create one. This works beautifully in most scenarios and also the easiest to consume.
Also, you're writing the copy so everything depends on the way you write it

### ü§îWhen do you choose image memes?

#### The original dialogue doesn't fit the context
When the audience look at an image meme, they're playing the scene in their head. This allows room for modification in that dialogue.

In the below example, the original dialogue is "Eppoyachu without na okay, eppovume without na eppadi pa"

When you replace one or two words from it, the sanctity of the template is intact.

Example
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When colleagues want to do &#39;a quick meeting&#39; to discuss something <br><br>&quot;Eppoyachu meeting na okay, eppovume meeting na eppadi?&quot; <a href="https://t.co/imdxCVps5r">pic.twitter.com/imdxCVps5r</a></p>&mdash; Sanjeev NC (@yenceesanjeev) <a href="https://twitter.com/yenceesanjeev/status/1321394166081835008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

#### The original scene is famous enough
It's also important to choose popular templates for image memes. If the audience can't recognise the scene, then the meme will fail.

Example
This image meme would work well because this dialogue of "Unna evan jaangari kuduka sonnathu" is famous enough for audience to make a connection with your copy immediately. They would read it in that tone and it would immediately make sense.

#### üëç Pros
- Easy to consume
- Easy to share

#### üëéCons

## GIF memes
This has grown in popularity over the recent times thanks to platforms like Twitter and Whatsapp (Later Google & Apple Keyboard) supporting GIFs. GIF memes are harder to create but they provide a perfect balance between video memes and image memes.

The reactions and expressions and the action itself can be easily conveyed through a GIF without the hassle of turning on the audio for the audience. GIFs are also far more accurate in conveying the reaction than an image

### ü§îWhen do you choose image memes?

#### When the one image cannot convey the reaction
Sometimes, you need a GIF because the image is too less to convey what you're trying to say.

**Example**
In this situation, an image would've been hard to convey the message of emptying the pocket. At the same time, a video meme would've been an overkill because the audio doesn't add value at all

#### When the dialogue of the scene is inconsequential
Sometimes, you need the reaction in a scene with dialogues but the dialogue itself doesn't fit in the context

**Example**
In the below example, the dialogue in the audio doesn't fit our concept and hence would've been a distraction.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When someone opens their mask to talk to me <a href="https://t.co/phtWvnh1LB">pic.twitter.com/phtWvnh1LB</a></p>&mdash; Sanjeev NC (@yenceesanjeev) <a href="https://twitter.com/yenceesanjeev/status/1299997595373383680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 30, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

#### üëç Pros
- Easier to consume than video memes
- The reaction is accurately captured so your copy can be light

#### üëéCons
- Hardest to create
- Sharing formats can be tricky
- Hard to download and share

#### üõ†Ô∏èTools
- Giphy
- Native screen recorder

### Video memes
Something that's growing in popularity over the last few years thanks to better internet, powerful smartphones and fully capable mobile video editors

### ü§îWhen do you choose image memes?

#### When the dialogue fits **perfectly** to your situation.
Video memes will work beautifully if the dialogue fits perfectly, focus on perfectly.

**Example**
Here the dialogue fits perfectly in the situation, hence a good candidate for video memes
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When people mark you as optional in meeting invites <a href="https://t.co/58xku7xpM5">pic.twitter.com/58xku7xpM5</a></p>&mdash; Sanjeev NC (@yenceesanjeev) <a href="https://twitter.com/yenceesanjeev/status/1297778619511713798?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 24, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

#### When the dialogue is well known
You might come across a scene that's not super popular and hence an image or GIF cannot convey the story. In times like this, you might have to choose a video meme.

If you've picked your template from unpopular sources like interviews, you definitely need video memes until that template becomes popular.

**Example**
In the below example, this is not a very popular scene and hence it's impossible for people to remember this dialogue. Once everyone sees the video though, it instantly fits
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When I use Google Chrome to search ‚Äúwhy is my laptop too slow‚Äù<br><br>Laptop: <a href="https://t.co/YXxYi4h8jo">pic.twitter.com/YXxYi4h8jo</a></p>&mdash; Sanjeev NC (@yenceesanjeev) <a href="https://twitter.com/yenceesanjeev/status/1304302116283076609?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 11, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

#### When you want to communicate a complex situation
The advantage of a video meme is that you have multiple images. That means, you have the option to convey multiple micro memes to create a mega meme.

**Example**
In the below example, a lot of multiple things had to come together to convey the situation of last day office. This would've been impossible to do with just a image or GIF.
Also, the background music is a huge plus.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Last day office scenes <a href="https://t.co/imSlhN32Pn">pic.twitter.com/imSlhN32Pn</a></p>&mdash; Sanjeev NC (@yenceesanjeev) <a href="https://twitter.com/yenceesanjeev/status/1294308986934763522?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

#### üëç Pros
- Lowest work for the copy as the template would do the trick itself
- Provides the maximum impact as the accompanying video will easily makes the audience laugh

#### üëéCons
- Good quality videos can be hard to source
- Video editing is a skill that will require some training

#### üõ†Ô∏èTools
- Native screen recording
- InShot (Mobile)
- Kapwing (Desktop)

### Advanced Techniques

#### Meme Dubs
This hasn't grown that much in popularity because it is quite difficult to create. The idea of a meme dub video is that you use the video from the original scene but replace the dialogue with your own voice.

**Example**
In the below example, the comparison is between Kokki Kumar asking for MLA Seat vs a junior member of a customer support team asking to be the manager. The comparison could only be brought out with original dialogues.

#### Video/Audio Swap
By simply swapping the audio of the scene with a different dialogue or a song, you could create a meme that's funny

**Example**
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just leaving this here <a href="https://t.co/ZWpxyiNMIb">pic.twitter.com/ZWpxyiNMIb</a></p>&mdash; Sanjeev NC (@yenceesanjeev) <a href="https://twitter.com/yenceesanjeev/status/1280400310029225984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 7, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
