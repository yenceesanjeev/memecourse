## Story
This is not something most meme-creators think about. The story is what the meme tries to communicate.

~~~
Definition:
The story in the template and the scenario
~~~

If you think about the real world and the meme world as two separate realms, the story is what connects them both. If the story is absent, the meme just falls flat, refusing to be funny

Example
In this scenario, the story in both situations is that happiness and money are missing in your life. You want it but it's not there. It is eluding you and you're not eluding it

The first case won't work because the story in that meme signals that happiness and money are being offered to you, which is not the case
