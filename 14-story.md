## Story
This is not something most meme-creators think about, or even understand. The essence of the meme is the underlying **story** that your meme is trying to convey

### **Definition**:
The **story** in the template and the scenario

The essence is what brings the scenario and the meme together. If you think about the real world and the meme world as two separate realms, the essence is what connects it. If the essence is absent, the meme just falls flat, refusing to be funny
Example
A meme that doesn't match the essence of your core situation will fall flat despite it looking like a legit meme and all the other aspects of it matching
In this scenario, the essence in both situations is that happiness and money are missing in your life. You want it but it's not there. It is eluding you and you're not eluding it
The first case won't work because the essence in that meme signals that happiness and money are being offered to you, which is not the case
