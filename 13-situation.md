## Situation
The situation is where the meme usually emerges from. Situations are found all around us if you decide to observe. You can find loads of situations at the workplace, in the news or sometimes in your own house.

This is also often referred to as "concept"

Definition:
The real world situation that you intend to compare

The situation is often the source of your meme ideas. The situation needs to be relatable for your audience.

Example
Without a situation, you would have no meme. In this case, the situations is that my life neither has happiness nor money
