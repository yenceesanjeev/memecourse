## Situation
The concept is also a popular term in the meme nation but it's interchangeably used (often confused with template)

### **Definition**:
The **real world situation** that you intend to **compare**

The concept is often the source of your meme ideas. The concept needs to be relatable enough to your audience.
Example
Without a concept, you would have no meme. In this case, the concept is that my life has no happiness or money
