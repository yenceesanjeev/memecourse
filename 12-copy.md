## Copy
The copy on the meme is actually the one that invokes the laughter. It's because, the template is familiar to the audience. It's only the copy that's new to them.

When you look at a meme, you're not laughing because of the template. You're laughing because the **copy brings the template into context**

In the below example, the copy on the right will not invoke the same level of laughter as the copy on the left despite it conveying similar messages.
