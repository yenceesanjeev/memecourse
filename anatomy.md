A meme consists of **five distinct elements** grouped into **two section.**
## The Visible Elements
  The visible elements of the memes are the ones you can directly see an interact. They are your levers to craft the perfect meme.

  They are:
  - Copy
  - Template


## The Invisible Elements
  The invisible elements are the ones that you can not see, interact or impact. But, the absence of these elements will be felt. You control the invisible elements by adjusting the visible ones.

  They are:
  - Situation
  - Story
  - Connection

## Example

#### The Visible elements
**Copy**
"When you can neither be happy bor be rich in life" & micro copies
"My Life", "Happiness" and "Money"

**Template**
"Ohhh jodiya miss aagireengala" from Middle Class Madhavan

#### The Invisible Elements
**Concept**
Your life has no happiness or money

**Essence**
Two things are missing in your life

**Connection**
Both Kozhanthaivelu and my life are asking "Ohh, jodiya miss aagareengala?"

## Why are these elements important?
A meme is funny when it's got the right balance in all these elements. It's like cooking -- you need the right ingredients (elements) in the right ratio and when something is missing, you notice right away
There will always be exceptions.


## Template
Template is the easiest to understand among all elements. It is what we're most familiar with. A template is the empty canvas upon which you paint your meme.

### **Definition**:
A screenshot or video from a movie with which you intend to create a meme

A common mistake in the meme world is to find random Vadivelu images and use that to say whatever they want to say. This seldom works.
From our earlier example, if you tried to use the template on the left - it won't work. It's got nothing do with what we're trying to convey

## Copy
The copy on the meme is actually the one that invokes the laughter. It's because, the template is familiar to the audience. It's the copy that's new.

### **Definition**:
The text that accompanies the template

When you look at a meme, you're not laughing because of the template. You're laughing because the **copy brings the template into context**

In the below example, the copy on the right will not invoke the same level of laughter as the copy on the left despite it conveying similar messages.

## Situation
The concept is also a popular term in the meme nation but it's interchangeably used (often confused with template)

### **Definition**:
The **real world situation** that you intend to **compare**

The concept is often the source of your meme ideas. The concept needs to be relatable enough to your audience.
Example
Without a concept, you would have no meme. In this case, the concept is that my life has no happiness or money

## Story
This is not something most meme-creators think about, or even understand. The essence of the meme is the underlying **story** that your meme is trying to convey

### **Definition**:
The **story** in the template and the scenario

The essence is what brings the scenario and the meme together. If you think about the real world and the meme world as two separate realms, the essence is what connects it. If the essence is absent, the meme just falls flat, refusing to be funny
Example
A meme that doesn't match the essence of your core situation will fall flat despite it looking like a legit meme and all the other aspects of it matching
In this scenario, the essence in both situations is that happiness and money are missing in your life. You want it but it's not there. It is eluding you and you're not eluding it
The first case won't work because the essence in that meme signals that happiness and money are being offered to you, which is not the case

## Connection
This element is adjustable â€” you tune it enough to get what you want in the end. The connection defines the difference between a sumaar meme and a viral meme
**Definition**: The invisible between the copy and template
The connection taps into the viewers mental model of that template. They would have understood the template as something. If your copy doesn't reflect that, then the connection doesn't happen and the meme is not funny.
