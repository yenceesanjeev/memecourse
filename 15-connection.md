## Connection
This element is adjustable â€” you tune it enough to get what you want in the end. The connection defines the difference between a sumaar meme and a viral meme
**Definition**: The invisible between the copy and template
The connection taps into the viewers mental model of that template. They would have understood the template as something. If your copy doesn't reflect that, then the connection doesn't happen and the meme is not funny.
