## Connection
This element is adjustable â€” you tune it enough to get what you want in the end. The connection defines the difference between a sumaar meme and a viral meme

~~~
Definition:
The invisible connect between the copy and template
~~~

The connection taps into the viewers mental model of that template. They would have registered the template as something. The connection will tap into that source and connect it to your copy, thereby communicating the story you want to say.

If your copy doesn't reflect that, then the connection doesn't happen and the meme is not funny.

<a href = '/20-creation/' class ='nav-button'> 2. Meme Creation -> </a>
