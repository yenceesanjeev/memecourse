Making memes is powerful. You have the ability to attract an audience and get them to share what you create. The idea behind a meme is that you're using something that already exists (a template) to communicate your message. Therefore, it's important to consider how you do that

## Out of bound templates
There are certain templates that you should never use
Photos of friends and family
Photos of non-celebrities
i.e anyone who hasn't **publicly** made their photos available

## Polarising topics
Do not use memes to communicate a propoganda or agenda

## Sensitive topics
Memes are meant to be funny and satirical. if you're going to be using memes to talk about sensitive issues, it's not really a good idea. Save that for your biography

## Promotional content
You cannot use memes to promote yourself or any other form of main promotion. This is in clear violation of the meme art

## Communicating social awareness
While it's really awesome to create awareness through memes, there are certain things that are better left for serious artforms like journalism.

## Anything that you don't know about
Since the meme can be interpreted out of context, generally stay away from creating content that doesn't fall into your own area of expertise
