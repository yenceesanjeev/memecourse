title: 2.3 Source Template
---
---

Once you have the format decided, the next step is to source the templates. Let's look at possible sources for these templates

## Image memes
It's the easiest to get but tricky to choose. Most of the templates are easily available on the internet.

Before sourcing it yourself, try searching for the right keyword on Google under the image search section. If that doesn't get you what you want, then you can go on YouTube to get the right template

Watch out for
- The right framed screenshot
- Quality of the image
- Bad hand movements

However, this is slightly tricky to create because you need to identify the right screenshot for maximum impact.

**Example**
While both the screenshots are only few seconds apart, you can clearly see that the second one conveys the dialogue better. Spend some time moving the image around to find the right one that fits.

## GIF memes
This one is slightly harder. The chances of the GIF already being available is pretty slim. Even if it is, it may not be trimmed to its precision.

In this case, your best bet is to use a third party website like [gifs.com](http://gifs.com) to create it yourself

## Video memes
Even though it looks complex, video memes are the easiest source. On most smartphones, the screenrecord option is good enough. You should be able to record over YouTube videos to get the template.

However, it's becoming increasingly difficult to source HD templates on YouTube and that is a worriable cause. Hence, you'll spend a lot of time finding the right video. Even if you own a subscription to SunNxt or Amazon Prime - they won't let you screenrecord over them.

Pro Tip: If you're really serious about meme creation, I would recommend investing in a VPN software. It lets you access pirated websites like einthusan and tamilyogi. That makes the entire process of sourcing templates very smooth because you always have access to HD templates and you don't have to waste time in searching
