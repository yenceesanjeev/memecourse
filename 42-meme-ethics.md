## Most photos are out bounds
I try to create memes only from movies or tv shows, ocassionaly extending that to celebrity interviews. Photos of friends or family is out of bounds. It doesn't matter how close they are to me or how fine they'll be with it. I don't have the right to use their photos for memes. Even if they consent, I will refuse.

## Never intentionally hurt someone
Generally, I stay out of making memes about sensitive topics. If I know that my meme could hurt a group of people, however small, I will not do it. However, if someone's being a baby about it you really can't do anything. It's subjective really, so at your own risk.

## Never promote your own stuff through Memes
I consider this a cardinal meme sin. Most of the "meme pages" are guilty of this. But I also know they make a lot of money. So...

## Communicating social awareness
I look at memes as commentary to public events. While I'm comfortable poking fun at something, I try not to bring my own personal opinions and bias into it.

## Anything that you don't know about
I generally stay away from topics I know little about. Just because everyone's talking about it, you don't have to jump on the bandwagon immediately.
