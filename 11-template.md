## Template
Template is the easiest to understand among all elements. A template is the empty canvas upon which you paint your meme.

Definition:
A screenshot, GIF or video with which you intend to create a meme

A common mistake in the meme world is to find random Vadivelu images and use that to say whatever they want to say. This seldom works.

From our earlier example, if you tried to use the template on the left - it won't work. It's got nothing do with what we're trying to convey.

<a href = '/12-copy/' class ='nav-button'> 1.2 Copy </a>
