Instagram is another great plaform for memes but it's slightly harder to get virality. The rason being someoen has toe xplicitly share your memes to people or share iti n their story

Format:
1:1 Images work best on Instagram

But it definitely helps build an audience. Instagram makkal tend to follow you for your memes much faster. The post will automatically bring someone to your profile and they're more likely to check out your profile

I am not focusing on the 'meme page' side of things because
1) I don't know how they work and
2) I think they're scam
